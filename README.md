# ListBeat-APP
ListBeat is a personal music catalog developed during the HackaTruck Makerspace program. It allows users to add songs and albums, rate them, write reviews, create custom playlists, and track their listening history â€” all stored locally or in the cloud via Cloudant, with a backend powered by Node-RED.
